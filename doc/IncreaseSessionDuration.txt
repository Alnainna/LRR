Increasing session duration
---------------------------

By default, the session duration in PHP is set to 1,440 seconds (24
minutes). However, this is not convenient in most software
systems. Therefore, we may need to increase the duration to allow
users to have more session time. To increase the session duration, we
need to edit the variable *session.gc_maxlifetime* in **php.ini**. We
can increase its default value to whatever we want (e.g., 7200).  On
Ubuntu, the file is located at */etc/php/7.2/apache2/php.ini*. On
XAMPP, the file is located at */xampp/php/php.ini*.
